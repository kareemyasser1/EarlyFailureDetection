# 🚀 GitHub Setup Guide

This guide will help you push your Turbofan Engine RUL Prediction System to GitHub.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git installed on your system
- Your project is already initialized with Git (✅ Done!)

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `turbofan-rul-prediction` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `CNN-LSTM model for predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines with Streamlit web interface`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/turbofan-rul-prediction.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Alternative: Using SSH (Recommended for frequent use)

If you have SSH keys set up:

```bash
# Add remote with SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/turbofan-rul-prediction.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Verify Your Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files including:
   - `README.md` with project description
   - `app.py` and `app_demo.py`
   - `requirements.txt` files
   - Documentation files
   - Sample data

## 📁 Repository Structure

Your GitHub repository will contain:

```

## 🌟 Repository Features

### Badges
Your README includes professional badges showing:
- Python version compatibility
- Streamlit version
- TensorFlow version
- MIT License

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- TensorFlow installation guide
- Contributing guidelines
- Docker deployment options

### Code Quality

## 🚀 Next Steps After Upload

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)
If you want to host documentation:
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Select source branch (usually `main`)
4. Your docs will be available at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/turbofan-rul-prediction`

### 2. Set Up Issues and Projects
1. Enable Issues in repository settings
2. Create issue templates for bugs and features
3. Set up project boards for task management

### 3. Add Repository Topics
1. Go to repository main page
2. Click the gear icon next to "About"
3. Add topics like:
   - `machine-learning`
   - `deep-learning`
   - `streamlit`
   - `tensorflow`
   - `predictive-maintenance`
   - `aerospace`
   - `cnn-lstm`

### 4. Create Releases
1. Go to "Releases" section
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Tag version: `v1.0.0`
4. Release title: `Initial Release - Turbofan RUL Prediction System`
5. Describe features and capabilities

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Model File
- The `best_cnn_lstm_model.h5` file (1.6MB) is included
- Consider using Git LFS for large files if needed
- For production, consider storing models separately

### Sensitive Data
- No API keys or sensitive data are included
- Sample data is anonymized
- All configurations are safe for public repositories

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Large File Issues
If you get errors about large files:
```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track large files
git lfs track "*.h5"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Add Git LFS tracking for model files"
```

### Authentication Issues
If you get authentication errors:
1. Use personal access tokens instead of passwords
2. Set up SSH keys for easier access
3. Check GitHub's authentication documentation

### Push Rejected
If your push is rejected:
```bash
# Pull any changes first
git pull origin main

# Then push again
git push origin main
```
